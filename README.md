# Data Privacy Final Project
A project writeup of 1-3 pages, containing:
* A problem statement
* A technical description of your solution, with emphasis on anything that makes your solution unique; your description should be sufficient to enable the reader to reproduce your implementation
* A description of the results - if you’ve evaluated your implementation on real data, describe how well it works
* If your project is a critique of an existing system, a longer writeup of at least 4-5 pages is expected instead of an implementation
